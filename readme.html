PARAGRAPH: 
Hi there! I'm Alex. I'll be attending Northwestern University in the Fall, studying Computer Science. My hobbies include running, playing games, and making music and art.

In this portfolio I will include some pieces of my art, photos of my running career, and ways you can contact me.

My favorite word? Flabbergasted! It is a great word to describe how I feel when I learn all sorts of new things.
